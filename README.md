## 🚀 About Me

What drives me to design is the challenge of making something beautiful *and* useful. I’ve always been drawn to how games blend storytelling and interactivity to immerse users it's what pulled me into the world of design.

When I’m not designing, I’m usually gaming, making music, or shooting hoops.

## ✨ What I'm Building & My Expertise

I'm passionate about translating ideas into thoughtful, usable, and human-centered experiences. My skills include:

### 🧠 User-Centered Design  
From interviews and usability testing to personas and user flows, I keep user needs at the core.

- **Studdy Spotter** — A web app for discovering and reviewing campus study spaces. I led the UX research and design, building a clean, filterable interface to help students find spots based on Wi-Fi, noise level, and outlets.

### 🎨 UI/UX Design & Prototyping  
I bring ideas to life through wireframes, mockups, and interactive Figma prototypes.

- **MindfulU** — A self-care and mood-tracking app designed in 24 hours during DubHacks. We focused on creating a calming, accessible interface with soft color palettes and simple interactions earning us 2nd place in our category.

### 🗺️ Visual Storytelling & Interaction Design  
Inspired by games, I craft experiences that feel immersive and emotionally resonant.

- **Tourify** — A mobile app designed to help users explore exhibits through guided audio walking tours. I focused on creating playful yet easy to follow visuals to keep users engaged while on the move.
