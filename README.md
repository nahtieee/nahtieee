## 🚀 About Me

What drives me to design is the challenge of making something beautiful *and* useful. I’ve always been drawn to how games blend storytelling and interactivity to immerse users it's what pulled me into the world of design.

When I’m not designing, I’m usually gaming, making music, or shooting hoops.
